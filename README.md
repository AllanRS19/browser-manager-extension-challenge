## My process

### Built with

- [Vite]
- [React]
- [TailwindCSS]
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to properly organize elements so that they can fit in the screen no matter the device size, as well as implementing the dark mode feature for it.

### Useful resources

- [Vite Documentation](https://vite.dev/guide/) - This is the Vite documentation page, which is what I used to develop this application. In there, I was able to gather and search all the information that I needed to succeed in this challenge.
- [TailwindCSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode) - This is by far my preferred CSS framework to style my applications. I used the guide to enable the dark mode feature.
